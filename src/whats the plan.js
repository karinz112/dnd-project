// building arays of hats,shirts,shoes,genetics(facial hair,eyes,)which parts of them fit their own color

//start with two items (shirt and shoes)
//add svg configuration to the project
//zoom into the parts of the body
// create  7 races of characters
//create functions and events to each item that can fit to the body part
//create menu of colors
//consider the possibility of using other packages and UIs




//FUNCTIONALITY
//buttons -> switch sprites over body parts (next hat -> change hat sprite)
//mouse-events -> click over specific parts of the body, to access THAT specific UI. I.E: load different UIs through body part clicks
//HUE slider? (color)?!
//zoom into selected body-part -> possibly viewport manipulation

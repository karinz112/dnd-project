    <h2>Hello there!</h2><br>
    <h2>We are 3 young developers who made this website especially for D&D players just like us.</h2>
    <h2>We were trying to create our characters and faced some obstacles along the way.
        Our imagination was too rich we couldn't visualize it to each other.
        This website is a great tool for anyone who had the same troubles as we did.
        We hope you enjoy our website and it can come in handy :)</h2>
